# repos run

The `run` command executes a shell command or a named recipe in each of the
specified repositories.

## Usage

```bash
repos run [OPTIONS] <COMMAND_OR_RECIPE> [REPOS]...
```

## Description

This is one of the most powerful commands in `repos`, allowing you to automate
tasks across hundreds or thousands of repositories at once. You can run any
shell command, from simple `ls` to complex `docker build` scripts.

Additionally, you can define **recipes**—multi-step scripts—in your
`config.yaml` and execute them by name. This is perfect for standardizing
complex workflows like dependency updates, code generation, or release
preparation.

By default, the output of each command is logged to a file in the `output/runs/`
directory, but this can be disabled.

## Arguments

- `<COMMAND_OR_RECIPE>`: The shell command to execute or the name of the recipe
to run. If it is a command, it should be enclosed in quotes if it contains
spaces or special characters.
- `[REPOS]...`: A space-separated list of specific repository names to run the
command in. If not provided, filtering will be based on tags.

## Options

- `-c, --config <CONFIG>`: Path to the configuration file. Defaults to
`config.yaml`.
- `-t, --tag <TAG>`: Filter repositories by tag. Can be specified multiple times
(OR logic).
- `-e, --exclude-tag <EXCLUDE_TAG>`: Exclude repositories with a specific tag.
Can be specified multiple times.
- `-p, --parallel`: Execute the command or recipe in parallel across all
selected repositories.
- `--no-save`: Disables saving the command output to log files.
- `--output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>`: Specifies a custom directory for log files
instead of the default `output/runs`.
- `-h, --help`: Prints help information.

## Recipes

Recipes are named, multi-step scripts defined in your `config.yaml`. They allow
you to codify and reuse common workflows.

### Defining a Recipe

Add a `recipes` section to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
recipes:
  - name: update-deps
    steps: >
      git checkout main
      git pull
      cargo update
      cargo build --release

  - name: test
    steps:
      - |
        cargo test --all-features
        run: cargo clippy
```

Each recipe has a `name` and a list of `steps`. Each step is a shell command
executed sequentially.

### Running a Recipe

To run a recipe, use its name as the main argument for the `run` command.

## Examples

### Run a command on all repositories

```bash
repos run "git status"
```

### Run a command on repositories with a specific tag

```bash
repos run -t backend "mvn clean install"
```

### Run a command on repositories matching multiple tags

This will run `npm install` on repositories tagged with either `frontend` or
`javascript`.

```bash
repos run -t frontend -t javascript "npm install"
```

### Exclude repositories from a run

This will run `cargo check` on all repositories *except* for those tagged as
`archived`.

```bash
repos run -e archived "cargo check"
```

### Run a command in parallel

This is highly recommended for long-running commands to save time.

```bash
repos run -p "docker build ."
```

### Run a command without saving output

Useful for quick, simple commands where you don't need a record of the output.

```bash
repos run --no-save "ls -la"
```

### Run the 'update-deps' recipe on all repositories

repos run --recipe update-deps

### Run the 'test' recipe on backend repositories in parallel

repos run -t backend -p --recipe test
